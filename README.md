# Optimized PWM Search Algorithm

### Overview

This research was developed during my internship at Valeo, where I worked as part of the Power (Inverter) Team. The goal was to build a search algorithm to optimize the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for a given input speed. The algorithm aimed to achieve efficient performance considering key parameters:

Torque pulse

Inverter loss

Rated torque

Power delivery

## Explored two primary approaches
Greedy Algorithm: A heuristic-based method to iteratively improve PWM optimization.

Mathematical Optimization: Combining the Tchebycheff Norm and Compromise Programming for multi-objective optimization.

This project highlights my proficiency in algorithm design and optimization within the domain of power inverters.

## Key Features
Efficient PWM Search Algorithm: Achieves balance among competing parameters for optimal performance.

Comparison of Techniques: Performance evaluation of greedy and mathematical approaches.

Integration with Power Inverter Systems: Ensures practical applicability in real-world automotive systems.

## Tools and Technologies
Programming: Python

Mathematical Modeling: Tchebycheff Norm and Compromise Programming
